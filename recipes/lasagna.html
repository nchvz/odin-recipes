        <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>This classic lasagna is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! This is great for feeding a big family, and freezes well, too.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Ground beef</li>
                <li>Bell peppers</li>
                <li>Onions</li>
                <li>Tomato sauce</li>
                <li>Tomato paste</li>
                <li>Crushed tomatoes</li>
                <li>Cheese (ricotta, shredded mozzarella and parmesan)</li>
                <li>Noodles</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
                <li>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
                <li>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
                <li>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</li>
        
            </ol>
